# SPAM FILTER SPECIFIC SETTINGS

# This example is for dspam, the way its configured on a Datux SYN-3 server.
# Requires a patched dspam version.

# Header and header-value that classify a mail as spam.
header_result       = X-DSPAM-Result
header_result_spam  = Spam

# Header that stores the original recipient/user of the mail. (some filters require this when retraining a mail)

# Header that stores the unique id thats required to retrain a message.
header_id           = X-DSPAM-Signature

# Actual script that is called to do the retraining.
# Parameters:
#  $1: spam-filter user
#  $2: spam-filter message id or token
#  $3: retrain classification: 'spam' or 'innocent'
#  $4: when a previous training should be undone, this has the value 'undo' (e.g. when the user moves a message user back to the previous folder again)
#      most filters dont support this, and you will probably just retrain the data again.
